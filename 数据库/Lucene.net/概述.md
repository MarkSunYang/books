Lucene .net 的两个重要版本
3.0和4.0

一些概念：

## Documents and Fields
Lucene stores document and documents are comprised of fields.
The fields can  be variety of types like Text, string or Int32.

Documents may have many fields.
There is no concept of schema and documents dont need to all have the same fields.
When searching you can search any field and it will only return documents which have field and where the data in that field matches the specified search criteria.


## Writing and Reading Documents
Documents are written via an IndexWrite and read via an IndexReader.
Although in practice we often use an IndexSearcher(which wraps an IndexReader) for searching and reading documents.


## Lucene Directories
