CQRS中包含了：

领域实体：理论上应该有两套，一套业务用于显示和用户操作，一套数据库持久
Domain Objects: Classes that represent how our data is modeled on the read side.

# Command

#Commands: 
表示最终用户发出的命令的类，应用程序将处理这些命令。（比如用户的查询，添加操作）
Classes that represent commands made by the end user, that will be processed by the application.

#Command Handlers: 
将解释命令并启动相应事件的类。
Classes that will interpret commands and kick off corresponding Events.

#Command Bus: 
表示命令队列的类。放置在总线上的命令由一个或多个适当的命令处理程序处理。
A class that represents the queue for the Commands. Commands placed on the bus are processed by one or more appropriate Command Handlers.

#Event

#Events: 
这些类表示对数据存储中的数据所做的更改，并由命令启动。这些类被序列化到事件存储中。一个命令可能引发许多事件。
Classes that represent changes made to the data in the data store, and are kicked off by Commands. These classes are serialized into the Event Store. One Command may kick off many Events.

#Event Handlers: 
解释事件并将其存储到事件存储库的类。
Classes that interpret the Events and store them into the Event Store.

#Event Bus: 
表示事件队列的类。放置在此总线上的事件由一个或多个适当的事件处理程序处理。
A class that represents the queue for the Events. Events placed on this bus are processed by one or more appropriate Event Handlers.

# 持久层
Event Store: The place where the Events are stored. For our application, this will be a SQL database.
Command Interface: The application which accepts Commands. For our solution, this will be an ASP.NET Web API application.

# Query
Query Interface: The application which accepts Queries. Can be the same application that has the Command Interface. For our solution, this will be an ASP.NET Web API application.

1. A Commandis generated from the UI
2. The Message Router or Bus receives the command
3. The handler prepares the aggregate root
4. The command is issued
5. The command handler requests the changes
6. The command handler requests persistence of the uncommitted events
7. The events are published onto the Bus or Message Router
8. De-normalisers build up the Read Model
9. Data Transfer Objects are persisted to the Read Model
10.
