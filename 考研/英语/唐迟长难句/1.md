# 主干  三步

1. 连词
Sun is singing, Mark is dancing. 错误
Sun is singing and Mark is dancing.
1.1 并列连词
and or 
but yet
连接前后相同成分（从后往前找相同）

1.2 从属连词
W 从属连词 连接从句 
还可以跟动词不定式：

n个连词可以连n+1句话

+ that 


2. 动词（谓语）
第一人称+动词原形
be+Ving
情态动词
have/has/had + done
be + done

状语从句的省略
when I was young, I could study English.=when young, I could study English.
前后分句主语一致，从句谓语含有be动词
though he was blamed, he never changed his mind.=though blamed, he never changed his mind.

When a new movemnet in art attains

补充：
宾语从句：I believe that god is a girl.(宾语是一个句子)
主语从句： That god is a girl is obvious. 主语是句子

形式主语 
It is obvious that god is a girl. 
It  is + adj. + that
                to do 

强调句
。。。



3. 介词
in on at of off with
介词不做主干 

主干    非主干
主语    定语    a book on the desk  修饰主语或宾语
谓语    状语    修饰谓语    On Sunday morning, we come to
宾语    补语
