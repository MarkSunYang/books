小小的 bit
什么是电脑？我们可以用它来看图片，玩游戏，查收邮件，网上聊天，还有更多的功能呢，但是电脑中真的饿存在图片吗？

This computer part is a simple device that has three connections where there may or may not be some electricity. Two of those
connections are places where electricity may be put into the device, and the third connection is a place where electricity may
come out of the device.

This computer part is a device that does something with bits. If you have two bits, and you connect those two bits to the inputs,
this device "looks" at those two bits, and "decides" whether to turn the one output bit on or off.
